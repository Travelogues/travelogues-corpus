# Travelogues Corpus

A corpus of German language travelogues from the period 1500-1876, drawn from the 
[Austrian Books Online project](https://www.onb.ac.at/digitale-bibliothek-kataloge/austrian-books-online-abo)
of the [Austrian National Library](https://www.onb.ac.at/). The corpus was compiled by the domain experts
of the [Travelogues Project](https://travelogues-project.info), using the [SACHA](http://iiif.onb.ac.at). Texts 
are the result of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and were not manually corrected. Travelogues is funded through 
grant I 3795 of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), and grant 398697847 of the German Research Foundation
(DFG).

## Accessing Digital Objects Online

Book and metadata files are named according to their barcode identifiers in the Austrian
National Library. The permanent URLs to the digital objects can be constructed by prefixing 
the barcode with `http://data.onb.ac.at/ABO/+`, e.g. for barcode `Z180627808`:
[http://data.onb.ac.at/ABO/+Z180627808](http://data.onb.ac.at/ABO/+Z180627808).
